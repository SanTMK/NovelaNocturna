        <h2 id='the-story'>The Story</h2>
        <p>In the second book of The Stormlight Archive—Words of Radiance—we are introduced to a solution to the final words of King Gavilar.</p>
        <p><em>Q: What is the most important step a man can take?</em></p>
        <p>Dalinar initially assumes the answer to be self-evident: the first.</p>
        <p>We must understand that by, the third book, the main events are already set in motion. We know all of our main players and have a deep, if still mystified, understanding of the world of Roshar. Our main factions are coming head to head for the second time. With all the pieces active, there is little importance in the fact that the efforts to defend the world have started.</p>
        <p>Dalinar, much like Kaladin, has been suffering from depression for most of this book. The memories of Eve being unlocked have reverted him to an aimless state where he feels like a hypocrite and a fraud. After all, he is the warlord who killed thousands of innocent people, even—if indirectly—his own wife, in the quest for glory.</p>
        <p>No, the first step was taken a long time ago. It will not matter in the end for Dalinar and all the people who depend if they end up consumed by the Voidbringers.</p>
        <p>What matters is to keep going: <em>to take the next step</em>.</p>
        <h2 id='my-life'>My life</h2>
        <p>Up to this day, I have been quite disappointed with the direction my life has turned. I would have thought to have more achievements to my name—things I can cal my own accomplishments.</p>
        <p>For the most part, what I have is what has been given to me. So, while it has given me an invaluable sense of security, I feel it has deprived my soul of a drive for more. I have become someone who is all too glad to just stay in my  lane and ignore the events around me. I will avoid all types of conflict and stay by myself almost everyday. </p>
        <p>The truth of the matter is that I can keep living like this indefinitely, but it will lead to an empty like. </p>
        <p>I do not want to waste my youth. <em>So I must take the next step.</em></p>
